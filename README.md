# Notes:
- if there is no commands or archs then an exception will pop up so i need to check when there is no records
- need to find a way to print archeticture better
- add a command to show the commands and archeticture with details
- check if a file is already exsits then it should ask if the user like to overwrite it or not and add some option to overwrite 
- deploy it to github and ask Jawad and Afraa to try building it and contribute to it
- add some issues about features that you want to add in the future
- publish it in packagist and try composer require global loaidev6/lola
- write a convenient documentation
