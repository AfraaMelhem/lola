# Notes:
- check if a file is already exsits then it should ask if the user like to overwrite it or not and add some option to overwrite 
- deploy it to github and ask jawad to try building it and contribute to it
- add some issues about features that you want to add in the future
- publish it in packagist and try composer require global loaidev6/lola
- write a convenient documentation
